          <p>Before you can begin to determine what the composition of a particular paragraph will be, you must first
            decide on an argument and a working thesis statement for your paper. What is the most important idea that
            you
            are trying to convey to your reader? The information in each paragraph must be related to that idea. In
            other
            words, your paragraphs should remind your reader that there is a recurrent relationship between your thesis
            and the information in each paragraph. A working thesis functions like a seed from which your paper, and
            your
            ideas, will grow. The whole process is an organic one—a natural progression from a seed to a full-blown
            paper
            where there are direct, familial relationships between all of the ideas in the paper.

            <br>
            The decision about what to put into your paragraphs begins with the germination of a seed of ideas; this
            “germination process” is better known as brainstorming. There are many techniques for brainstorming;
            whichever
            one you choose, this stage of paragraph development cannot be skipped. Building paragraphs can be like
            building a skyscraper: there must be a well-planned foundation that supports what you are building. Any
            cracks, inconsistencies, or other corruptions of the foundation can cause your whole paper to crumble.

            <br>

            So, let’s suppose that you have done some brainstorming to develop your thesis. What else should you keep in
            mind as you begin to create paragraphs? Every paragraph in a paper should be:
            <br>
            <br>

            Unified: All of the sentences in a single paragraph should be related to a single controlling idea (often
            expressed in the topic sentence of the paragraph).
            Clearly related to the thesis: The sentences should all refer to the central idea, or thesis, of the paper
            (Rosen and Behrens 119).
